## Packages
framer-motion | Immersive UI animations and transitions
clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind classes safely

## Notes
A-Frame and AR.js must be loaded via script tags in index.html (already handled in implementation notes, but worth reiterating for runtime context).
The AR scene will require specific CSS to handle the video feed background correctly.
